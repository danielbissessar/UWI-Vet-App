Project Name: Veterinary Rotation Clinician Tool
Group Members: Matthew, Varun, Daniel

## PROJECT SCOPE STATEMENT 
	The final product is intended to be a mobile application that will allow clinicians to enter data on a per student per rotation basis that will be stored to a database. The application should also generate a summary report on a per student or per rotation basis for the entire year.

## GENERAL PROJECT INFORMATION
	The University of the West Indies Veterinary School has been using a paper based system to log information based on the rotation of students over the past years. In using this system, the Veterinary School found that this method has become too cumbersome to efficiently manage their current system. In addition, the magnitude of information that is burden to each clinician  has become to overwhelming and as such the development of a new technique to address the problem was directed to the Department of Computing and Information Technology(DCIT) UWI. 
	Despite the new approach that would be undertaken, there are notable consequences such as the data storage options i.e. the size and timeframe that data would be needed to be stored. Mention was made to the fact that data had to be stored for as far back as 5 years and as such given the amount of data, proper constraints would need to be put in place for this criteria. 
	Another potential drawback would be the need to create a simple and clear product which is easy to interact with. The uniqueness of the project stems in the fact that this shift from the old system to the new one would be the first of its kind for the Veterinary School and as such with the increase in the student population there was a need for a more efficient system. In addition the project is aimed at streamlining the data collection method for clinicians and alleviate the workload.

## PROBLEM / OPPORTUNITY STATEMENT 
	The current clinician system involves students per rotation to fill out a booklet which is then collected and validated by a clinician in the field. At the end of each year, clinicians are made to manually collate student data for summary reports. The major contributor to the need of this application is that clinicians may have up to 300 records to enter. Summarizing this data becomes grandiose task for clinicians at the end of each year. Should an alternative to their current system be implemented, it would: 
	(i) reduce time wasted on the field entering data, 
	(ii) reduce errors caused by student entry, 
	(iii) eliminate the need to collate student reports. The ignorance of these factors potentially jeopardise the integrity of 			veterinary studies, staff engagement, quality of workplace life and optimal use of time.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
	Goal 1: User Verification 
  		Objective 1.1: Enabling user verification before accessing the application.  
  		Objective 1.2: Ensuring that only Clinicians have access to enter data and alter data on the application.

	Goal 2: Data Collection
  		Objective 2.1: Entering each competency into the application database 
  		Objective 2.2: Entering the required procedures for each competency.
  

	Goal 3: Streamlining Data Collection
		Objective 3.1: Allowing a fast and efficient method to enter data. 
  		Objective 3.2: 


	Goal 4: Generate Summary Reports
  		Objective 2.1: The creation of final summary reports based on data collected by clinicians about  students’ performance 
  		Objective 2.2: Reports would be clear and precise outlining the progress of a student throughout the semester.

	Goal 4: ???



## PROJECT DESCRIPTION 
	Includes:
	Data creation/retrieval/update/deletion per student per rotation, summary report generation.
	Database: to allow clinicians to keep records of students’ rotations per semester for each academic year. 

	Does Not Include
	Student creation, editing rotation composition.

## BUSINESS BENEFITS 
	The potential benefits that the Veterinary School stand to derive from the project would include: The application would provide a faster and easier alternative to the current system. The input of data would be in real time and as such mobile apps are quick and take only a few seconds to launch. Reduced costs compared to the traditional method. As the majority of students and staff have smartphones the level of accessibility is greatly increased. There is no need for the traditional pen and paper format or recording data.  Risk mitigation, with the introduction of the mobile app, the platform would allow filling the form on the field and then linking back the Veterinarians’ database once back on campus.


Stakeholders that interact with the application 
Able to review, approve and alter content on the application.
Organizations
External organizations that have partnered with the Veterinarian School  
Heads of Department that can use the application to view reports of students as well as Clinician Reports.

	- Project Timeline and Use cases 
	- Implementation Document 
	- Final Project Report

## ESTIMATED PROJECT DURATION
	The estimated project duration would be approximately 3-4 months. This would encompass back-end and front-end development. The back-end would be the logic of the application, the data process mechanisms and component integration and performance. Some tasks include:
	- Data Storage 
	- User Management 
	- Data Integration 
	- Front-end development relates to the user interface and user experience. This has the following scope:
	- Caching - Temporary data storage
	- UI Design - The actual User Interface (UI) screens. 
	- UI Development - The programming code corresponding to the UI design is written. 


### WORK DISTRIBUTION
	Daniel Bissessar -
